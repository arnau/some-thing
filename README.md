# Some Thing

`some` is a tool to manage “some” collections. 


## Why

[Awesome] lists are a nice idea but consuming them is quite difficult beyond
casual browsing. As per managing one, I haven't even tried.

So, this tool could be focused on [Awesome] lists but their requirements are
divergent enough from mine. And let's face it, I don't tend to awe, Finding
something useful in a particular context is more than enough for me.
