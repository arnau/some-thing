# Some Thing

`some` is a tool to manage “some” collections.


## Why

I find the [Awesome] lists quite a nice idea but managing and consuming them
not so much beyond casual browsing.

This is an attempt to address the issue by focusing on packaging the data in a
consumable format i.e. [Tabular Data Package] and secondarily, display it as a
`README.md` file in a similar vein as Awesome.
